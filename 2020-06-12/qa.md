12:13:17      From Joe Nadeau : 

**Splice variants, what is the relative occurrence of differences in mRNA levels versus splice variants, especially with respect to functions and phenotypes?**

 

12:15:44      From Joe Nadeau : 

Do strain-specific microbiome profiles affect heritability estimates?

 

12:25:38      From Robert W Williams : 

But how do thresholds for "acceptance" of cis and trans eQTLs compare. Trans eQTLs require genome-wide test, but cis eQTLs require only a local test.

 

12:33:44      From Joe Nadeau : 

Why are tests for cis eQTLs limited to local, rather than genome-wide? Following Lander-Kruglyak (Nat Genet, back in the day, ’96?). Why not a genome-wide ‘penalty’ for cis tests? According the L-K logic, one would have tested many, perhaps very many candidate cis eQTLs yes?

 

12:35:18      From Karl Broman : 

You don’t need to control for the genome wide search, but you may want to control for the number of expression traits you’re looking at.

 

12:40:33      From @lil_herodotus : 

how to appropriately test for gene overlap between two modules? Say I built one with expression data and another with splicing data? How do I compare eTurquoise and sTurquoise for example

 

12:41:56      From Robert W Williams : 

Does WGCNA make it possible/easy to also define antagonists (enemies, as it were)?

 

12:53:06      From Robert W Williams : 

In WGCNA how do you avoid LD artifacts?

 

12:53:53      From Joe Nadeau 

What constitutes evidence to independently validate an expression module?

 

13:12:01      From Priscila Darakjian : 

Has anybody compared cis-eqtls to hub genes (in WGCNA). Could we argue that hub genes would most possibly be cis-eqtl genes, and those with high connection to these hub genes could be what we categorized as trans-eqtls?

 

 

13:12:41      From @lil_herodotus : 

Do you have a recommended module size when building the network?

 

13:18:01      From Saunak Sen : 

How do your methods change for other omic data such as microbiome, metabolome, etc vs transcriptome?
