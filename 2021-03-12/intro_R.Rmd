# R data type

A data type is a variable attribute which indicates to the R interpreter how you expect to use the variable in your program. The basic data types used in R are: 

* Integer, i.e., natural numbers
```
varA <- 7L
```

* Numeric, i.e., decimal numbers and natural number
```
varB1 <- 3.14
varB2 <- 8
```

* Complex, i.e., complex number
```
varC <- 2+ 7i
```

## R data type

* Logical, i.e., boolean
```
varD1 <- TRUE
varD2 <- FALSE
```

* Character, i.e., string (text)
```
varE <- "apples"
```

# R data structure

There exists different ways to store a set of values in the computer. A specific way to organize the data set is called a data structure. In R programming, the basic data structures are:

* Vectors
* Factors
* Matrices
* Lists
* Data frames  


## Vectors

* A vector is a collection of elements with identical data type. 
```{r vectors}
# The function c() concatenates elements to create a vector

vec1 <- c("March", "July", "September"); print(vec1)

vec2 <- c(7, 22, 19); print(vec2)

vec3 <- c(7, "test", 19); print(vec3)

```


## Factors

* A factor is a vector that is used to store categorical data. 
* The categories' labels are called levels.


```{r factors}
# Use function factor() to convert the vector into a factor
fac1 <- factor(c("A", "B", "B", "A", "D"))
fac1


# Define explicitly levels to include group C
fac2 <- factor(c("A", "B", "B", "A", "D"), levels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
fac2

```

## Matrices

* A matrix is a collection of values organized in a two-dimensional rectangular layout.
* All matrix elements have the same data type.

```{r matrices1}
# function matrix() converts a vector into a matrix 
# by specifying number of rows and columns.
mat1 <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), nrow = 2, ncol= 4); print(mat1)

```

## Matrices

```{r matrices2}
# Combine vectors with cbind() (or rbind()) function 
mat2 <- cbind(c(1,2), c(3,4), c(5,6), c(7,8)); print(mat2)

# Combine with rbind() function 
mat3 <- rbind(c(1,2), c(3,4), c(5,6), c(7,8)); print(mat3)

```

## Lists

* A list is a collection of elements whose data type and data structure can be different from each other.

```{r lists1}
# function list( ) concatenates objects to generate a list
lst1 <- list(vec1, mat1, sum); print(lst1)

```

## Lists

```{r lists2}
# It is possible to add names to elements of the list 
lst2 <- list(month = vec1, mymatrix = mat1, sum); print(lst2)

```

## Data frames

* Data frames are a two-dimensional structures used to store tabular data.    
* They are structured as a list of vectors having the same length, and where each vector may have a different data type.  
* Data frames have column names, and may have row names.
  

```{r dataframes_1}
# Build a data frame from the previous vector vec1 and vec2 
df1 <- data.frame(month = vec1, day = vec2)
df1
```


# Accessing elements from a data structure

* To extract one element or several elements from the basic data structures, use the square brackets `[ ]` specifying the position (aka index) of elements.
* In R, the index of the first elements starts with 1.


## Accessing elements from a Vector

```{r echo = FALSE}
noquote("Vec1:")
print(vec1)
```

```{r accessingV}
# To access the second element
vec1[2]
# To access the first and the third element
vec1[c(1,3)]
```

## Accessing elements from a Factor

```{r echo = FALSE}
noquote("fac2:")
print(fac2)
```

```{r accessingF}
# To access the second element
fac2[2]
# To access the first and the third element
fac2[c(2,4)]
```


## Accessing elements from a Matrix

```{r echo = FALSE}
print(mat1)
```

```{r accessingM1}
# To access one element specify the row and column index
mat1[2,3]
# To access the second column
mat1[ ,2]

```

## Accessing elements from a Matrix

```{r echo = FALSE}
print(mat1)
```

```{r accessingM2}
# To access several elements on different rows and columns
mat1[c(1,2), c(2,3)]
```

## Accessing elements from a List

```{r echo = FALSE}
print(lst1)
```

```{r accessingL1}
# To access one object of the list use double square brackets [[]]
lst1[[2]]

```


## Accessing elements from a List

```{r echo = FALSE}
print(lst1)
```

```{r accessingL2}
# To access elements in object use the double square bracket [[ ]] 
# followed by the conventional indexing
lst1[[2]][2, c(1:3)]
```



## Accessing elements from a Data frame

```{r echo = FALSE}
print(df1)
```

```{r accessingD1}
# To access elements of data frame, on can use the same indexing of the matrix 
df1[2, 1]
# We also can use the name of the column such as
df1$month[2]
```

## Accessing elements from a Data frame

```{r echo = FALSE}
print(df1)
```

```{r accessingD2}
# Replace "March" by "April" 
df1$month[1] <- "April"
# Replace the first date by 5
df1$day[1] <- 5
df1

```

# Programming a function in R

* In R programming, a function is a set of instructions that performs a specific task.
* R offers a large number of built-in functions; moreover, it is possible to create or customize functions too. 
* Generally, a function uses one or more argument part as inputs, then it processes arguments in the body part, and finally, it may return an output.   
* A rule of thumb is that if you are performing a task three or more times, you should write a function for that task.

## Programming a function in R

The standard syntax to create a function generally looks like the following example:    
    
```
function_name <- function(arg_1, arg_2, arg_3){
    
    statements_to_be_processed
    
    return(output_variable_name)
}
```

## Programming a function in R

```{r function}
# Assign square to a function with one argument, x
square <- function(x)
    {
       sqr <- x^2
       
       return(sqr)
    }

```

A few points to note:

* The name of the function is `square` which is on the left hand side of the assignment
* The function called `square` takes one argument, called `x`.
* The block of code to be executed when the `square` function is called is enclosed in curly braces(`{}`).

## Programming a function in R

```{r function2}
# Use function square
square(11)

```

# Reading data in R

One of the first steps in any data analysis project is to read data from a file. Data can come in myriad forms, but the most common and convenient form is the spreadsheet.

Assuming that your data is in a text file, R provides essential reading functions to turn a text file into a data frame according to a delimiter (or field separator).   


| Functions     |                   Delimiter |
|---------------|----------------------------:|
| `read.csv()`  |                       comma |
| `read.csv2()` |                   semicolon |
| `read.fwf()`  |       arbitrary fixed width |
| `read.delim()`|                         tab |
| `read.table()`|      customizable delimiter |



# Packages in R

A package is a bundle of R functions, documentation, tests and sometime data sets. They are usually developed to add specific functionality. 

* To add a a package in your library, run the `install.packages()` function, such as:   

```
install.packages("xlsx")
```

* To load a library, use the function `library()`:

```
library(xlsx)
```
