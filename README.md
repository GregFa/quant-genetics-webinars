# Quantitative Genetics Tools for Mapping Trait Variation to Mechanisms, Therapeutics, and Interventions - Webinar Series

The NIDA Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome has put together a webinar series, Quantitative Genetics Tools for Mapping Trait Variation to Mechanisms, Therapeutics, and Interventions. The goal of this series is to transverse the path from trait variance to QTL to gene.

Below is a list of webinars with additional material such as slides, notebooks, and answers to questions from the audience.  Readers are encouraged to interact using the Issues section.
