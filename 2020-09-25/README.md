# Introduction to Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis

## Laura Saba, PhD

### Pre-reading
["Good Enough Solutions" and the genetics of diseases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22859671/) - this paper from Jake Lusis's group is a great introduction to why co-expression network analyses are important and what they can contribute to the study of complex genetic traits

[A General Framework for Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16646834/) - This is one of the initial papers from Steve Horvath and Bin Zhang that describes the WGCNA method including a more detailed look at the statistical aspects.

[WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16646834/) - This is the original manuscript by Steve Horvath and Peter Langfelder that introduces the *wgcna* package for R.

[Is my network preserved and reproducible?](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001057) - this paper from Peter Langfelder, Rui Luo, Michael C. Oldham, and Steve Horvath includes details about calculating preservation of WGCNA co-expression modules
